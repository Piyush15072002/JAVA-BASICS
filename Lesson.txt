1. Download JDK - JAVA DEVELOPMENT KIT

2. There are two types of function in java
    a. ReturnType - Which returns a value
    b. Void - Which do not return anything

3. The main() is the entry point to the program

4. All functions should belong to a CLASS
    A CLASS is a function for one of more related function

5. Every JAVA program should have atleast one class which contains the main() function in it,
This is the 'class Main()' which is a class that holds the main() function

class Main{
    void main(){
        ...
    }
}

6. There are access modifiers in JAVA which are special keywords that determines if other classes can access this class or not
and there are few like - PUBLIC, PRIVATE, ETC
But for now, we will use the Public

public class Main{
    public void main(){
        ...
    }
}

# The "Pascal" naming convention is used when we name a class that is why in 'class Main()' 
the Main is capital, The "Pascal" naming convention is "SonGokuIsBest"
# To name our function, we use "camelCase"

7. To run your JAVA file without the IDE
Go to the same directory where file is present
> javac <name of file>.java
eg. > javac App.java

This will COMPILE your source code

8. The anatomy of the JAVA program is that
App.java is the main file which contains the source code
App.class is the file that contains the BYTE CODE, it is the compiled form of the .java file

9. BEHIND THE SCENES 
Two things happen when we run our program, COMPILATION and EXECUTION

The .java file (source code) is compiled by java compiler (which we got from JDK) into a .class file (BYTE CODE)

The JAVA BYTE CODE that we have is "Platform Independent" means it can run on any machine that has JRE (Java Runtime Environment)
This JRE has a component called as JVM (JAVA VIRTUAL MACHINE) which takes the BYTE CODE and execute it into the NATIVE CODE (windows, mac, etc)

.'. Source code ---> JDK (Java Compiler [javac]) ---> Byte Code
    Byte code ---> JVM ---> Native Code

=> To run your byte code from CMD 
> java <filename>


10. JAVA was developed by James Gosling in 1995
