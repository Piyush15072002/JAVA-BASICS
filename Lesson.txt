2. There are two types of function in java
    a. ReturnType - Which returns a value
    b. Void - Which do not return anything

3. The main() is the entry point to the program

4. All functions should belong to a CLASS
    A CLASS is a function for one of more related function

5. Every JAVA program should have atleast one class which contains the main() function in it,
This is the 'class Main()' which is a class that holds the main() function

class Main{
    void main(){
        ...
    }
}

6. There are access modifiers in JAVA which are special keywords that determines if other classes can access this class or not
and there are few like - PUBLIC, PRIVATE, ETC
But for now, we will use the Public

public class Main{
    public void main(){
        ...
    }
}

# The "Pascal" naming convention is used when we name a class that is why in 'class Main()' 
the Main is capital, The "Pascal" naming convention is "SonGokuIsBest"
